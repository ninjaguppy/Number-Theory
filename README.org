* Hello!

These are my notes for a sort of reading course going through Ireland and Rosens
"A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory." The pdf is above, which
contains notes (along with personal musing on number theory and the structure of
the text) as well as selected exercises for each chapter. Enjoy!

Note: at the moment I am still a bit behind when it comes to typing up the
exercise. I have the case of "I (though I) solved this at one point but now my
notes on the problem are incomprehensible."
