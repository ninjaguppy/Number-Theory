\chapter*{Chapter 1 Selected Problems}

\paragraph{Problem 6:} Let \(a,b \in \ZZ \). Show that the equation
\(ax+by =c\) has solutions in the integers iff \((a,b)\mid c\).

\paragraph{Problem 10:} Suppose that \((u,v)=1\). Show that \((u+v,u-v)\) is
either 1 or 2.

\paragraph{Problem 12:} Suppose that we take several copies of a regular polygon
and try to fit them evenly around a common vertex. Prove that this only possible
polygons are triangles, squares, and hexagons

\paragraph{Problem 16:} If \((u,v)=1\) and \(uv=a^2\), thow that \(u\) and \(v\)
are both squares.
